# FlightPlanner

--------------------
 
//Semester Project - Plan a Flight
 
This program determines feasible flight plans and calculates the total cost and time
 
for airline routes between cities using input flight data and requested flight plans.
 
It employs an array of linked lists to represent the flight network as a directed graph and
 
utilizes an iterative backtracking algorithm with a stack to explore all possible paths.
 
The output includes up to three optimal flight plans sorted by cost or time, or an error
